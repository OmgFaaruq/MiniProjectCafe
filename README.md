# MiniProjectCafe

Project Background:

Our client has launched a pop-up café in a busy business district. They are offering home-made lunches and refreshments to the surrounding offices. As such, they require a software application which helps them to log and track orders.

Client Requirements:
I want to maintain a collection of products and couriers.
When a customer makes a new order, I need to create this on the
system.
I need to be able to update the status of an order i.e: preparing,
out-for-delivery, delivered.
• When I exit my app, I need all data to be persisted and not lost.
• When I start my app, I need to load all persisted data.
• I need to be sure my app has been tested and proven to work well.
• I need to receive regular software updates


How did your design go about meeting the project's requirements?
collection of anything is lists so I created a product list, courier list and orders list
allow the user to choose which order in the order list they wanted to update. Once that was chosen, give them an option of statuses they could update the order with.




How did you guarantee the project's requirements?
